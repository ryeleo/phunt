If this project is made modular, it will be easier to work on now and take code
from if we ever do something similar in the future. For this reason I propose we
set the architecture as following.

-- phunt.c --
This has the main() function. Initializing all variables and running the event
loop is done here.
initialize_variables
while(1)
    item = parse_next_blacklistentry()
    handle(item)


-- config.c --
This will be able to do all of the parsing for stuff.


-- 


-- log.c --
This will hold all of the functions needed to gracefully print to the log.
