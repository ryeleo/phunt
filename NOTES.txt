If this project is made modular, it will be easier to work on now and take code
from if we ever do something similar in the future. For this reason I propose we
set the architecture as following.

-- phunt.c --
This has the main() function. Initializing all variables and running the event
loop is done here.
while()


-- action.c --
This will define a struct that represents an action, and there will be functions 
in here that allow the building and handling of actions as well.


-- actionlist.c --
This will be able to parse configuration and hold a list of all future actions
to be taken. We will be easily able to extract an action from this struct/file
and then use the 'handling of actions' methods from action.c to take care of the
actions in this structure.


-- log.c -- DONE
This will hold all of the functions needed to gracefully print to the log.
